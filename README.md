# Code Quiz

## Description
This application is a quiz that asks the user multiple-choice questions about Javascript.  The quiz starts with 60 seconds on the clock and begins a countdown when the start button is clicked.  Each wrong answer deducts 10 seconds from the remaining time.  When time is up or all questions have been answered, the remaining time displayed is the user's score.  The user is then asked to enter their initials, and the initials and score get recorded on the High Scores screen.
